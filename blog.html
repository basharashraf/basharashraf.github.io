    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a process that affects the visibility of your website or webpage in a web search engine's results. By ranking, the higher ranked and most frequently visited websites in a search engine  will recieve more visitors from the search engine's users and these visitors can be converted into customers.</p>

                <h3>Step 1: SEO your content strategy</h3>
                <p>Too many marketers are still waiting until the end of content creation to bring in SEO as a
promotional tool. They try to figure out what they’ve just created, so they can plug in a few
keywords and links.</p>
                <h3>Step 2: Design good content</h3>
                <p>Good UX is good SEO. When users are engaged, they consume more content, interact with it
and share it. From the overarching structure to the details of the layout, make sure you are
designing good content.</p>
                <h3>Step 3: Create correct content</h3>
                <p>Additionally, citing sources and linking to other authorities is good technique, but it’s also good
SEO — those outbound links demonstrate to search engines that you know your stuff, and that
you’re associating with the right crowd.</p>
                <h3>Step 4: Check your keyword usage</h3>
                <p>It’s true that keyword stuffing is very, very out. It was never cool in the first place, but now —
thanks to Google — it’s also ineffective (if not dangerous). It’s also true that Google is very
savvy about keywords. None of that, however, means that keywords are “dead.” It just means
SEO needs to use them better.</p>
                <h3>Bonus round: Some technical SEO content issues</h3>
                <p>Technical SEO is, mostly, an entirely different conversation. Most technical SEO factors are
sitewide issues that need to be audited, and the important ones cleaned up, before you start tryingto optimize content.</p>
